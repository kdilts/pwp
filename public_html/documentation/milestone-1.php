				<p>John has one hour before the end of the work day in which to choose one of many candidates from the numerous applications he received. He finds my application and decides to follow the link to this site from my resume. Upon viewing the stunning examples of my work catalogued on this site, he knows he simply must hire me, and proceeds to throw all of the other applications in the trash.</p>
