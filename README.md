Personal Website Project for Deep Dive Coding Boot Camp  
This is milestone one of the PWP project. It contains a purpose, audience, goal, persona, and use case.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
I remember that we talked about doing a multi-page project to accommodate the larger number of portfolio items you want to feature. This is something that should be detailed in the Use Case, for future reference. Overall what you have is a good start, but there is plenty of room for additional detail here, especially in your Use Case. Your Persona is good but the purpose, audience, goal and use case could be more specifically defined, especially in light of your gallery of past work.

Since you are looking at a multi-page layout, think very carefully about your content strategy and layout choices. Start with two pages: A home/landing page, and a content page. Only consider 3 or more pages if absolutely necessary. Remember that mobile and full-screen wireframes will be required for each unique page layout. Create no more than two layouts, max. 

Your HTML and CSS looks great. One very nitpicky note on CSS: It's a bit cleaner to put each comma-separated CSS Selector on its own line. Have a look at Edits &amp; Suggestions below for a note on your file structure.

Overall, very nice work. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin Milestone 2&alpha;

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- It would be a good idea to move all of your images and graphics inside an `/images` directory inside `/public_html`. Additionally, if you would like even more separation of concerns you can create an `/images` directory inside of `/documentation`, for your PWP Milestones only.
